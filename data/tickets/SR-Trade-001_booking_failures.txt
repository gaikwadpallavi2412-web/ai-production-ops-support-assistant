User Description:
Traders reported intermittent failures while submitting new trades via the booking API. Errors observed mostly during peak market hours.

Business Impact:

Approximately 3–4% trade booking failures

Manual re-entry required for some trades

Potential client dissatisfaction

Initial Investigation:

API latency elevated

Error logs showing DB pool exhaustion

Thread pool utilization near maximum

Actions Taken:

Checked database connection metrics

Identified orphan connections

Restarted affected API pods

Increased connection pool temporarily

Root Cause:
Database connection pool exhaustion during peak load combined with stale sessions.

Resolution:
Connection pool increased and stale sessions cleared. Monitoring added.

Validation:
No further failures observed for 2 hours post-fix.

Closure Notes:
Recommend permanent pool tuning and connection leak monitoring.
