Incident ID: INC-004
Service: trade-risk
Severity: P3
Region: Global
Detected By: CPU Alert – Risk Engine

Summary:
Sustained high CPU utilization observed on Trade Risk Calculation service pods during market open window. Alert triggered when CPU exceeded 85% for more than 10 minutes.

Business Impact:

Risk calculations delayed by ~3–5 seconds

No trade failures reported

Minor SLA breach for risk computation latency

Timeline:

09:02 UTC – CPU alert triggered

09:05 UTC – L2 investigation started

09:12 UTC – Pod metrics reviewed

09:18 UTC – Horizontal scaling applied

09:24 UTC – CPU normalized

Investigation Findings:

Increased trade volume at market open

Risk calculation threads running at max capacity

No memory pressure observed

No recent deployment changes

Root Cause:
Traffic spike during market open caused CPU saturation due to insufficient HPA threshold tuning.

Resolution:

Increased replica count from 4 → 8

Adjusted HPA CPU target from 80% → 65%

Monitored for 30 minutes

Duration:
22 minutes

Preventive Actions:

Review HPA settings quarterly

Add pre-market scaling policy

Improve capacity planning for peak windows

Status: Resolved
