Incident ID: INC-007
Service: payment-gateway
Severity: P2
Region: APAC
Detected By: Latency SLA Alert

Summary:
Payment gateway latency exceeded SLA threshold intermittently during peak transaction window.

Business Impact:

Payment processing delay up to 6 seconds

Small number of customer timeouts (~1.8%)

Increased retry traffic

Timeline:

11:32 UTC – Latency alert fired

11:36 UTC – L2 investigation started

11:41 UTC – Thread pool saturation observed

11:46 UTC – Pods scaled

11:55 UTC – Latency normalized

Investigation Findings:

Upstream bank response slower than usual

Gateway thread pool near saturation

No infra issues detected

Root Cause:
Upstream dependency slowdown combined with insufficient thread pool capacity.

Resolution:

Increased thread pool size

Scaled gateway pods

Enabled adaptive retry backoff

Duration:
23 minutes

Preventive Actions:

Add upstream latency dashboard

Implement dynamic thread tuning

Improve capacity forecasting

Status: Resolved
