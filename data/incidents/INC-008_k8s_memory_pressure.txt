Summary:
Kubernetes nodes reported memory pressure causing pod evictions in trade namespace.

Business Impact:

Two non-critical pods restarted

No customer impact

Increased restart noise

Timeline:

03:12 UTC – Memory pressure alert

03:15 UTC – Node metrics reviewed

03:19 UTC – High memory pod identified

03:26 UTC – Pod rescheduled

03:40 UTC – Node stabilized

Investigation Findings:

Trade-risk pods using higher memory than baseline

Node utilization > 92%

No memory leaks confirmed

Root Cause:
Temporary memory spike due to batch risk calculations.

Resolution:

Rescheduled heavy pods

Increased node pool capacity

Adjusted resource requests

Duration:
28 minutes

Preventive Actions:
